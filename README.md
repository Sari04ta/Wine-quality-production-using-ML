# Wine-quality-production-using-ML
This repository explores the use of machine learning (ML) to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical and physical properties. Predicting wine quality can be beneficial for:

Wine producers: Identifying factors that influence quality can help refine production processes and optimize winemaking decisions.
Consumers: Predicting quality can enhance selection and purchasing decisions.
Wine researchers: Understanding the relationships between wine properties and quality can guide research efforts.
